# Android strings.xml Mymemory Translator

A python script that generates translations for your Android strings.xml files based on the [MyMemory Translation API](https://mymemory.translated.net/doc/spec.php).

These translations are obviously not very sophisticated. They can serve as a foundation that needs to be reviewed by a person who can speak that language.
